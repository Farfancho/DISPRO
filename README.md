# DISPRO 3D SCANNER
System design with processors project for 2025-1 semester

Mecathronics engineering on PUJ

## Description of the project
This project is about the building a low-cost 3D scanner using a ESP32 microcontroller and finite state machines, the goal is to get a points cloud and a .stl file based on a real life object

### Disclaimer

Although the project was meant to be developed by groups of five students, the result didn't meet the expectations, that's why i'm taking another chance on it, by changing the microcontroller, all the coding, and the majority of the assembly.

## Components used
- ESP32 WROOM 32 Microcontroller
- 17HS4401S Stepper Motors
- A4988 Microstepping Drivers
- GP2Y0A21YK Distance Measuring Sensor
- OLED SSD1306-SH1106 Display
- Limit Swiches
- Startup Button
